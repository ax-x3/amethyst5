    <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
    <p>By commissioning artwork from me, you agree to be bound by the following terms as they appear on the date of sale. If you disagree with or violate any part of these terms, you renounce any commissions you have with me, and you may lose your privilege to commission me. These terms are subject to change, with or without warning.</p>

        <li>You agree to pay a partial fee upfront as a first-time client.</li>
        <li>You acknowledge that you have 2 weeks to respond if I request a response from you.</li>
        <li>You agree not to use my work to train or interact with AI in any way.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>DEFINITIONS</h2>
    <p>The following capitalized terms have meanings as defined below.</p>
    <p>“My Work” refers to any posted or published artwork or other media, regardless of quality, under any of my social media accounts, handles, and aliases, including commissioned work.</p>
    <p>“Commissioned Work” refers to any posted, published, or privately shared artwork or other media, regardless of quality, under any of my social media accounts, handles, and aliases that was produced by me for a commission recipient.</p>
    <p>“I”, “Me”, “My”, or similar references refer to Amethyst X., the person who produces/produced work under the alias “PoisonAivi” and owns/owned the World Wide Web domain “amethystx.net” starting from February 22, 2025.</p>
    <p>“Client” refers to any person or entity that has received Commissioned Work or has made a request for Commissioned Work.</p>
    <p>“You” or similar references refer to any person or entity that may interact directly or indirectly through the internet with My Work, including, without limitation, as a viewer of My Work and as a Client.</p>
    <h2>GENERAL COMMISSIONING AGREEMENT</h2>
    <p>I reserve the right to deny commission requests, terminate commissions that I previously approved for any reason, and post, publish, or privately share any Commissioned Work. You can not negotiate over a denied commission.</p>
    <p>I reserve the right to blacklist and warn other artists about You if You become a nuisance.</p>
    <h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
    <p>I will deny commissions that include sexual content, discrimination, realistic gore, photorealism, extreme complexity, vague descriptions, no reference, copyrighted work, or AI-generated content.</p>
    <p>Commissioned Work may not exactly match the quality or appearance that the Client envisions.</p>
    <p>Completion dates are approximate and subject to change without warning.</p>
    <h2>PAYMENT</h2>
    <p>Fees for any Commissioned Work will be agreed upon between Me and the Client before I begin work on the commission. First-time Clients must pay one-half of the commission fee upfront. Clients must pay the remaining fee within 72 hours of receiving the completed Commissioned Work.</p>
    <p>I have no obligation to complete Commissioned Work that has not been compensated for by the Client.</p>
    <h2>AVAILABILITY</h2>
    <p>I will only respond to Clients’ requests and messages when I am available. If I request a response from the Client, and I do not receive a response within fourteen (14) days, that Client’s commission is forfeit, and I am no longer obligated to complete the Commissioned Work for that Client.</p>
    <p>Commissioned Work will be completed in a first-come-first-serve order.</p>
    <h2>NO GENERATIVE AI TRAINING USE</h2>
    <p>You are explicitly prohibited from reproducing and/or otherwise using My Work in any manner for purposes of training artificial intelligence technologies to generate text, images, or other media, including, without limitation, technologies that are capable of generating works in the same style or genre as My Work. You are also prohibited from sublicensing others to reproduce and/or otherwise use My Work in any manner for purposes of training artificial intelligence technologies to generate text, images, or other media.</p>

    <h2>ATTRIBUTION (BY)</h2>
    <p>You are prohibited from removing, covering, or cropping any signature, watermark, tag, or credit from My Work.
