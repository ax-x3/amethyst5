    <h3>A table which appears to float. </h3>
    <p>Of course, it's not magic. It's being supported entirely by tension. The load on the table's top surface is transported down the upper arm, which delivers the force through a cable onto the lower arm, which rests on the floor.</p>

    <img class="photo readingColumn" src="images/tensegrity001.png">
    <p>Disappointed by the availability of plans, I decided to make my own.</p>
    <p>I made this 3d model in OnShape. The design is heavily based on <a href="https://youtu.be/LZvlNqjSPcA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>this YouTube video</u></a>, but I made some changes to improve the strength of the tensegrity arms. I also replaced the edge fillets with chamfers because they looked more angular and futuristic.</p>

    <img class="photo readingColumn" src="images/tensegrity002.png">
    <p>The next step was to draw usable plans from my design.</p>
    <p>Also using OnShape, I pulled out each of the main components and made a cut list with precise measurements. Unlike the 3d model, these can be printed out and referenced easily while cutting the wood.</p>

    <h4>September 18, 2025 • Step 3</h4>
    <img class="photo readingColumn" src="images/tensegrity003.png">
    <p>To make a pair of identical arms, I made a template out of hardboard.</p>
    <p>I wanted to make sure each tensegrity arm was exactly the same size and shape, so I cut out a template on the bandsaw after measuring everthing out with a ruler and protractor.</p>

    <h4>September 26, 2025 • Step 4</h4>
    <img class="photo readingColumn" src="images/tensegrity005.png">
    <p>I squared up a piece of oak to 2" by 3", then traced my template onto it. The wood was slightly wider than I planned, but I figured it would end up helping with the strength of the piece, so I changed some of my plan dimensions to match the width.</p>
    <p>Afterwards, I measured out the 22° angle for each end and cut it on the miter saw. The edge of the board should be 12" long, but the original boards need to be longer to accomodate for the angled cuts. The cuts left rough borders, so I smoothened them with a file before resurfacing on the joiner.</p>

    <h4>October 1, 2025 • Step 5</h4>
    <img class="photo readingColumn" src="images/tensegrity006.png">
    <p>Using the bandsaw, I cut out the template I had traced, being sure to leave at least 1/16" of margin around the cut lines. This way I could sand them down later to be exactly the right dimensions.</p>
    <p>I accidentally cut slightly too deep on the relief cuts for the corners, but it should be fixable when I sand down the material around it.</p>

    <h4>October 7, 2025 • Step 6</h4>
    <img class="photo readingColumn" src="images/tensegrity007.png">
    <p>Next, I had to remove the margins that I left while using the bandsaw, and clean up the corners that I cut too far on. First, I used a sanding block to clear up the corners where the orbit sander wouldn't be able to reach.</p>
    <p>The orbit sander left a surprisingly smooth surface, even along the ends of the board. I kept alternating between sanding block and orbit sander until the margin was gone.</p>

    <h4>October 8, 2025 • Step 7</h4>
    <img class="photo readingColumn" src="images/tensegrity008.png">
    <p>Now that the arms are mostly complete, I started working on the edges of the triangular faces. The board I had originally set aside for the faces was too short, so I'll need another. I planed them to 3/4" and cut them into 3 inch widths on the table saw.</p>
    <p>The face edge is trapezoidal, with the long edge measuring 14" and the corner angles being 60°. I should've left extra space when using the table saw, because the saw left burn marks that I'll have to sand away.</p>
